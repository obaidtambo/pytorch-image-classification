## **2. Step 1: Docker Setup**

### Docker Setup Instructions

1. **Install Docker**: Begin by installing Docker on your system if it's not already installed. You can download Docker from the official website (https://www.docker.com/get-started).

2. **Pull the PyTorch Image**: Once Docker is installed, open a terminal or command prompt and pull the PyTorch image from the NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NCG) catalog using the following command:

   ```
   docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:11.2-py3-pytorch-1.10.0
   ```

3. **Run the Container**: After pulling the image, run it as a container, ensuring that your modified repository is mounted:

   ```
   docker run --gpus all -it --name dlprof_container -v /path/to/your/repo:/workspace nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:11.2-py3-pytorch-1.10.0
   ```
   Replace `/path/to/your/repo` with the actual path to your modified repository.

## **3. Step 2: Repository Modification**

In your modified repository, ensure the following modifications:

1. **Include Required Libraries**: Include the `nvidia_dlprof_pytorch_nvtx` and `dlprofviewer` libraries in your repository.

2. **Modify Training Loop**: Modify your training loop to include profiling with `torch.autograd.profiler.emit(nvtx)` indentation. This will enable DLProf to capture performance data.
